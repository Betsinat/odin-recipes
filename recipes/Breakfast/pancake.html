    <h1>Pancake</h1>
    <p>Pancakes are soft, fluffy, and golden-brown treats made from a simple batter of flour, milk, eggs, and a touch of sugar. They are often enjoyed for breakfast or brunch, served warm with butter, syrup, fruits, or even chocolate. Loved for their light texture and comforting taste, pancakes are a timeless favorite that can be customized with endless toppings and flavors.</p>
