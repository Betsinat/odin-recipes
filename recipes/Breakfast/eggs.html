    <h1>Fried egg</h1>
    <p>A fried egg is a quick and delicious way to enjoy eggs, perfect for breakfast or as a topping for rice, toast, or burgers. With its crispy edges and soft, runny yolk (or fully cooked if preferred), a fried egg adds flavor and texture to any meal. Itâ€™s simple to prepare yet satisfying every time.</p>
